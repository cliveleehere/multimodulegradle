Watch the corressponding talk for Droidcon Boston 2018 for more detailed explanations!
Link to video and slides will be posted here!

Slides are here https://github.com/cliveleehere/multimodulegradle/raw/master/Pragmatic%20Gradle%20for%20your%20Multi-Module%20Projects%20final%20final%20final.pdf

On the day of the talk, Android Gradle Plugin 3.1.0 got released! Everything in the slides / repo should stay the same, except:
- update the Android Gradle Plugin Version
- the [cache fix plugin](https://github.com/gradle/android-cache-fix-gradle-plugin) only addresses data binding features now
