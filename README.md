Link to video and slides will be posted here!

Slides are [here](https://speakerdeck.com/cliveleehere/pragmatic-gradle-for-your-multi-module-projects) 

On the day of the talk, Android Gradle Plugin 3.1.0 got released! Everything in the slides / repo should stay the same, except:
- update the Android Gradle Plugin Version
- the [cache fix plugin](https://github.com/gradle/android-cache-fix-gradle-plugin) only addresses data binding features now
